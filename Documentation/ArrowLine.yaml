example: |
  -- Create an arrow line from point A to point B
  local line = ArrowLine()
  line.from = vec2(100, 100)
  line.to = vec2(200, 200)
  line.color = ColorRGB(1, 0, 0)  -- Red
  line.width = 2.0
  line:show()

notes:
  - ArrowLine is client-only and cannot be used in server-side scripts
  - Inherits all UIElement properties and methods
  - Width property appears in both ArrowLine-specific and inherited properties
